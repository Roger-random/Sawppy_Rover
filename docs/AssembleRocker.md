# Rocker Assembly

Rocker portion of suspension arm links the front wheel to the bogie assembly.
The whole suspension subassembly is then mounted to the main body box.

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes each * 2 sides = 1 hour total

You will use the 161mm and 182mm extrusions for this.

You will also need the Bogie End, Front Corner, and the Rocker printed parts.
