# Recommended Order of Assembly

This is the order I assembled my rover in, planning ahead to make sure all nuts were in place for later assemblies


**Order:**
* Order hardware
* Print all parts
* Cut all shafts
* Install M3 inserts
* Assemble upper rail for differential
* Assemble upper side rails for body
* Assemble lower side rails for body
* Assemble upper rear rail for battery holder
