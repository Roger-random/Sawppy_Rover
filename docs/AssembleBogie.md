## Sawppy V1 Errata
Sawppy v1 has a design flaw where it is easy to make the mistake of using the
left side Bogie-Wheel part on the right side of the rover. (And vice-versa.) Several
rover builders ran into this, and I am contemplating several ways to improve. In the
meantime please be aware: If a Sawppy rover's middle wheels are splayed out at
an angle rather than forward-back as designed, it is because the Bogie-Wheel parts
had been installed left-right reversed from intended. (Thanks to
