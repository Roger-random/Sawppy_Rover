## Shafts
The following are lengths and quantites for the shafts. You should make the differential axle from steel, and the others can be made from aluminum or steel.

If you're careful and/or lucky, you can get all the shaft you need from a pair of 500mm shafts, not counting the 300mm shaft you need for the differential shaft.

Please see [Shaft dimensions](Shaft8mm.md) for more details. 

The lengths below are approximate, depending on groove size. The important dimensions are the distances between the grooves.
