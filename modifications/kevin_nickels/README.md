## Modifications made by Kevin Nickels, Trinity University

Dr. Nickels has made a version of the Sawppy rover at Trinity University in San Antonio, TX.  He has made several minor modifications to the design to target what he considers potential weaknesses.

The first modification simply uses LX-224 servos intead of the LX-16A, due to supply chain issues.

The second uses a bolt and nut to hold the bracket to the steering knuckle and fixed knuckle instead of threading directly into the plastic or even threading into a heat-set insert, for strength.

 He plans to make similar changes to joints as they fail, starting with the steering knuckle to sheeting shaft joint, which has already failed (the heat set insert pulled out) on one corner.
 This can be found in the CAD, in the DriveShaft_Setsrew branch.
