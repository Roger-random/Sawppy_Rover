# Support Sawppy via Amazon Associates Program
Sawppy the Rover is a project done out of love of our interplanetary robotic
explorers Curiosity and Perseverance. Sawppy's design and instructions for
construction are shared with other rover lovers free of charge under the
permissive MIT license.

Some very generous people have offered to donate to
help the project. I have declined offers of direct donation, but I have
set up an Amazon Affiliates account based on suggestion. If an aspiring
rover builder buys components from Amazon (USA) using the links
below, they will pay the same price but Amazon will send a (very small)
percentage of the sale to me as sales commission.
Here is the boilerplate disclosure:
_As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases._

I have other links to Amazon products scattered throughout Sawppy
documentation, but they are generic links that do not earn commission.
This is the only page with affiliate links.
