# Rocker Assembly

Rocker portion of suspension arm links the front wheel to the bogie assembly.
The whole suspension subassembly is then mounted to the main body box.

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes each * 2 sides = 1 hour total

You will use the 161mm and 182mm extrusions for this.

You will also need the Bogie End, Front Corner, and the Rocker printed parts.

Rocker subassembly plus bogie subassembly. The three wheel mounts should all be roughly in line with each other, with the center wheel extending slightly farther away from the body than the corner wheels. If the center wheel is splayed outward at an angle, the Bogie Wheel part has been swapped side to side.
