## Cost estimate

__Option 1: Cut the beams yourself__

Purchase standard 2-meter lengths of HFS3 from Misumi and cut to length yourself. This is the most economical option if you have
a saw that can cut aluminum. Or if you have more time than money and willing to hacksaw all the pieces by hand.
This is also the best option if you want to experiment with modifying the rover design.

Fortunately Sawppy is designed so precise length is not necessary, and the cut ends don't have to be perfectly square.
An extrusion can be up to 5mm shorter than specified, or have sloped cut ends, and the rover will still work. Such
imperfections can be compensated for with few extra millimeters of space when bolting plastic pieces onto beams.

The above lengths add up to 3922mm. If you are really good with planning and have a very thin saw blade, you might
be able to cut all rover parts out of two 2-meter pieces of extrusion. 

2 * $7.40 = $14.80

Realistically, you will probably need three beams which will leave plenty left over for future rover additions.

__Option 2: Order beams from Misumi cut to length__

Misumi offers a configurable length service where they will cut the beams to your specified lengths. This will result
in perfectly square cut ends and the lengths will be very accurate. Misumi guarantees +/- 0.5mm but internet forum
posts indicate in practice it's far more precise than that.

The convenience and precision will cost $42.32.
