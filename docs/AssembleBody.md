For proportion faithful to Curiosity rover side view seen in Onshape CAD file, there should be 62mm of aluminum extrusion visible between front face of "Rocker Body mount" and rear face of front "Body Corner".

In practice this can be moved forward/back as the builder pleases to maintain best balance for their rover chassis. Which will vary with every rover build as it depends on what's installed in equipment bay.
